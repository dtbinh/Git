= How to report bugs =

I'm not able to test the Toolboxes on all platforms and currently R2013a is what I am working with.  MATLAB evolves so there can be problems if you use older or newer versions. I do welcome your help in finding and fixing bugs.  If you post a bug report be sure to include:


  # what you do and how MATLAB/Toolbox responds, cut and paste your session
  # the output of the `ver` command which looks something like this
