    % Add other parameters to the serial port
    % Convert format 2 commands to format 1 with CRC
    % Check CRC from read messages
    
    % Implement public methods for wraping the API functions
    % These methods must set the parameters correctly and treat the
    % obtained reply.
    % These methods should comprise: init, start, stop, read, etc
